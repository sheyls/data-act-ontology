## DAOnt: EU Data Act Ontology

Formal Ontology for Automated Compliance with Regulation (EU) 2023/2854

### Overview

This repository provides the first comprehensive ontology for the EU Data Act (Regulation 2023/2854), enabling automated deontic reasoning and compliance verification across business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and business-to-government (B2G) data-sharing scenarios.

The ontology integrates 3 foundational standards—LKIF-Core, ODRL, and DPV—to model obligations, permissions, and prohibitions in machine-readable form.
It allows organizations to verify compliance, detect violations, and evaluate FRAND conditions through SPARQL queries and semantic reasoning.

Applicable from September 12, 2025, the EU Data Act introduces complex requirements for data access and sharing. This ontology bridges the gap between legal text and computational enforcement, supporting interoperability in European data spaces and automated contract validation.

### Key Features

- Semantic Representation of the Data Act

    - Models rights, duties, and prohibitions across B2C, B2B, and B2G contexts.

    - Includes formal representations of:

      - Article 4(1) – B2C user access rights

      - Article 8(6) – B2B trade secret exceptions

      - Article 19(2)(a) – B2G competitive use prohibitions

- Multi-Standard Integration

- Automated Compliance Checking
  - SPARQL queries validate whether contractual terms satisfy Data Act requirements.
  - Python compliance checker (built with rdflib) executes reasoning tasks and reports results.
  - Results identify violations, exceptions, and unfulfilled obligations for each article-based contract.

## Installation and Usage
- Prerequisites
  - Python 3.9+
  - RDFLib
  - SPARQLWrapper

Install dependencies:

``pip install rdflib sparqlwrapper``

- Run a Compliance Check
``python run_compliance_check.py``
or 
``python run_compliance_check.py --contract contracts/b2b_8.6.owl --query queries/query-8.6.update.sparql``

The system will:
- Load the specified contract ontology
- Execute the compliance SPARQL query
- Return the list of fulfilled, violated, or pending obligations


## Proof-of-Concept Examples

Each compliance scenario includes:
- Formalized contract ontology (.owl)
- SPARQL compliance queries
- Screenshot of results

| **Scenario** | **Article** | **Description** |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **B2C** | Art. 4(1) | User access rights to connected product data |
| **B2B** | Art. 8(6) | Trade secret exceptions and FRAND conditions |
| **B2G** | Art. 19(2)(a) | Prohibition of data use for competitive purposes |
