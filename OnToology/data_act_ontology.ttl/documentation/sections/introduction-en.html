The EU Data Act (Regulation 2023/2854), applicable from September 12, 2025, establishes a unified legal framework for data access and sharing across the European Union. It governs three main contexts:

- B2C (Business-to-Consumer): granting users access to data from their connected products.

- B2B (Business-to-Business): enabling data sharing under user authorization and FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) conditions.

- B2G (Business-to-Government): allowing access to private-sector data in cases of exceptional public need.

Complying with these complex, interdependent legal obligations poses major challenges—especially for SMEs, which often lack the resources for continuous legal oversight. Current compliance processes are manual, error-prone, and non-scalable, and existing tools focus mainly on GDPR or AI Act obligations, leaving the Data Act largely unsupported. To address this gap, this ontology introduces a machine-readable regulatory framework for the EU Data Act. By representing legal provisions in formal, semantic terms, it enables:

- Automated deontic reasoning over obligations, permissions, and prohibitions.

- Semantic querying to detect compliance or violations in specific contractual scenarios.

- Interoperability with European data spaces through standards-based representations.

This ontology integrates LegalRuleML, LKIF-Core, ODRL, and DPV to formalize Data Act rules and demonstrate automated reasoning for representative articles:

- Article 4(1): user data access (B2C)

- Article 8(6): trade secret exceptions (B2B)

- Article 19(2)(a): prohibition of competitive use (B2G)

Through SPARQL-based reasoning examples, this project showcases how formal ontologies can make Data Act compliance verifiable, interoperable, and automatable.</span>
