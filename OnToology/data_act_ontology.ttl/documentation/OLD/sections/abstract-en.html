<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This repository provides the first comprehensive ontology for the EU Data Act (Regulation 2023/2854), enabling automated deontic reasoning and compliance verification across business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and business-to-government (B2G) data-sharing scenarios.

The ontology integrates 3 foundational standards—LKIF-Core, ODRL, and DPV—to model obligations, permissions, and prohibitions in machine-readable form. It allows organizations to verify compliance, detect violations, and evaluate FRAND conditions through SPARQL queries and semantic reasoning.

Applicable from September 12, 2025, the EU Data Act introduces complex requirements for data access and sharing. This ontology bridges the gap between legal text and computational enforcement, supporting interoperability in European data spaces and automated contract validation.</span>
